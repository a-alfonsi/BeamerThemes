# :triangular_flag_on_post: BEAMER THEMES

The repository hosts a growing list of Beamer themes:
*  The __Nikhef__ folder contains minimal themes I developed throughout my PhD, which were used by multiple people in official and non-official scientific and public talks
*  The __Nikhef_interview__ folder contains my first theme, created for my PhD interview presentation
*  Additional folders will be added in the future

&nbsp;

Feel free to download and use these themes by following the instructions in the specific folders. 

_Sending me a message if you do so would be very much appreciated!_
