# Nikhef Beamer themes

The repository contains two Beamer themes:
*  __Nikhef2019__ see example in file `exampleNikhef2019.pdf`
*  __Nikhef2019clean__ see an example in file `exampleNikhef2019clean.pdf`

&nbsp;

## :triangular_flag_on_post: HOW TO USE THE THEMES

The files `example*.tex` show how the two themes are loaded within Beamer.

Strictly speaking:
* Download the wanted `*.sty` file to the same folder where your `.tex` file is going to be created
* Select the theme by adding the line `\usetheme{*}` between `\documentclass{beamer}` and `\begin{document}`

__NOTE:__ `*` stands for the theme name (*Nikhef2019* or *Nikhef2019clean*)
