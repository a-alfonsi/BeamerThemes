# Nikhef interview theme

This folder contains my first Beamer theme, which I created for my interview talk as a PhD.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: HOW TO USE THE THEME

The file `nikhefexample.tex` shows how the theme is loaded within Beamer.

Strictly speaking:
* Download the repository files to the same folder where your main `.tex` file is going to be created
* Select the theme by adding the line `\usetheme{_nikhef}` between `\documentclass{beamer}` and `\begin{document}`
